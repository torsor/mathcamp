<h3><b>Project:</b> Combinatorial Geometry (Faculty Co-ordinator: <a
href="https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/petridis/">Giorgis Petridis</a>)</h3>

<p class="description">Combinatorics is the art of (sophisticated) counting. Can it be applied to questions in geometry? One can make a living by doing so. Want to begin to see how?</p>

<h3><b>Project:</b> Matrices and Curves on Surfaces (Faculty Co-ordinator:
<a href="http://euclidlab.org/david-gay">David Gay</a>)</h3>

<p class="description">This project is about finding all the ways that you can draw three green non-self-intersecting curves on a surface, intersecting 3 given red and blue curves, so that when you follow some interesting instructions to turn this diagram into a 3-by-3 matrix (grid of 9 numbers), the matrix has some special properties, which you'll learn about. So we'll learn about matrices, determinants of matrices, how matrices come from intersections of different colored curves, and we'll be searching for some interesting examples that may or may not exist. Maybe we'll find them, or maybe we'll learn why they can't exist. Lots of doodling, and playing around with numbers, and experimenting.</p>

<h3><b>Project:</b> What Numbers Could Not Be (Faculty Co-ordinator:
<a href="http://www.math.uga.edu/directory/toyin-alli">Toyin Alli</a>)</h3>

<p class="description">Logic includes a study of argumentation within natural language, consistent reasoning, valid argumentation, and errors in reasoning.  In this project we will use propositional logic to evaluate the validity of deductive arguments and the consistency of statements to answer the question, “Do numbers exist?” and determine what numbers could NOT be.</p>
