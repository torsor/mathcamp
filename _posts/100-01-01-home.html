<h4>What and Who</h4>
<p>At MathCamp, UGA faculty mentors each work with a graduate student helper,
and and undergraduate helper guiding a group of roughly 5 high school
students on exploratory projects in a range of topics. We plan to have 5 or
6 groups, for a total of 25-30 students. 
</p>
<p>
Topics vary year to year, but in
the past, they have included topology, graph theory, number theory,
cryptography, mathematical problem solving, and mathematical biology.
</p>
<p>
Activities are aimed at high school students entering grades 9-12, however
some younger students have also done quite well with the material in the
past. With this in mind, there are no formal grade level requirements.
The most important prerequisite is an interest in learning new things and
curiosity about mathematics!

<h4>When and Where</h4>
<p>MathCamp 2016 ran Monday, June 6 to Friday, June 10, in the Boyd
Graduate Studies Research Building (200 D.W. Brooks Drive), at the
University of Georgia Athens Campus.

<h4>How</h4>
<p>MathCamp is funded by <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1151252&HistoricalAwards=false"
>NSF CAREER grant DMS-1151252</a>,
and this grant pays for all our expenses except for food and t-shirts.</p>

<p>Participants will pay a small fee at the beginning of camp to cover the
