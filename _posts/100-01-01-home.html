<h3>We are working hard to get MathCamp 2018 up and running!</h3>

<br />
<p>If you are interested in our next MathCamp, please let us know by
filling out the form below!</p>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-SGNqFbQu-_xDv6srDI9H4X1zQcxG-_SULmcDAmn05g/viewform" >MathCamp email form</a>

<p>We expect to have a registration
form available soon.</p>


<h4>What and Who</h4>
<p>At MathCamp, UGA faculty mentors each work with a graduate student helper,
and and undergraduate helper guiding a group of roughly 5 high school
students on exploratory projects in a range of topics. We plan to have 5 or
6 groups, for a total of 25-30 students. 
</p>
<p>
Topics vary year to year, but in
the past, they have included topology, graph theory, number theory,
cryptography, mathematical problem solving, and mathematical biology.
</p>
<p>
Activities are aimed at high school students entering grades 9-12, however
some younger students have also done quite well with the material in the
past. With this in mind, there are no formal grade level requirements.
The most important prerequisite is an interest in learning new things and
curiosity about mathematics!
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h4>When and Where</h4>
<p>We plan to hold camp July 9-13, 2018, in the Boyd
Graduate Studies Research Building (200 D.W. Brooks Drive), at the
University of Georgia Athens Campus.


<br />
<br />

<h4>How</h4>
<p>MathCamp is funded by <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1151252&HistoricalAwards=false"
>NSF CAREER grant DMS-1151252</a>,
and we are grateful for the additional support provided this year by the
UGA Mathematics Department, which will supply us with snacks and t-shirts.</p>

<p>Participants also have the option of
either bringing their own bag lunch, or ordering from Jimmy John's or a
similar local restaurant (we'll coordinate a daily order from Jimmy John's
each morning, for those who are interested).</p>
