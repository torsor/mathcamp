<h2> Activities </h2>

<br />

This year's program will feature activity groups led by [Juanita Pinzón Caicedo](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~juanita/), [Ester Dalvit](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dalvit/), [Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html), [Paul Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/), Barbara Remmers and Amber Russell. Some of the group descriptions are available below:

<br />

**Braids**
([Ester Dalvit](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dalvit/))

<blockquote>
Can you put a closed rope a round the strands at the top of a braid such that it will have a specific shape when it falls down to the bottom of the braid?

<br />
<br />

Through hands-on activities and guided learning, students will develop mathematical tools to solve this puzzle. Along the way they will discover that both braids and curves are mathematical objects, and find a way to describe these objects and their interaction using algebraic notation.

**Monster Epidemiology: Zombies, Vampires, and Werewolves**
([Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html))

<blockquote>
In this workshop we will produce mathematical models to predict the outcome of an encounter between a healthy human population (for example, the town of Watkinsville) and a few mythical creatures. We will study: (a) humans vs. one zombie, (b) humans vs. one vampire, and (c) humans vs. a competition between several vampires and several werewolves… and any other apocalyptic scenario participants can come up with. Not only students will learn how to predict who wins, but also what are the best strategies to contain these mythical monsters. The mathematical tools used in this workshop belong to the same family of models used to guide public health policies against a number of diseases. We will use Scilab, an open source mathematical package, to explore the mathematical models needed in the study of  monster epidemiology.

**Primes**
([Paul Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/))

<blockquote>
We will explore several solved and unsolved problems about the set of prime numbers, ranging from classical results known to Euclid in 300 BCE to spectacular advances from just the past few years.

**Problem Solvers** 
(Barbara Remmers)

<blockquote>
Whether or not you are interested in competition, math contest problems are a great tool to improve problem solving abilities.  The problems are interesting -- many are written by mathematicians to illustrate important ideas -- and satisfying to solve.   They start off easy and end with very hard ones so each contest has something for everyone.

<br />
<br />

This will be an active group where most of the time will be spent grappling with problems, with help, hints, and coaching. The activities are aimed particularly at rising 9th and 10th graders. Students must have completed an algebra course.

**Discovering Graph Theory** 
(Amber Russell)

<blockquote>
Through a series of guided learning projects and hands-on activities, students will discover the basic definitions and some famous results from the field of Graph Theory. Specific topics include planar graphs, graph embeddings on surfaces, and the Four Color Theorem.
