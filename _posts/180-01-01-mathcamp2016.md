<h2> MathCamp 2016 </h2>

<p>MathCamp 2016 ran Monday, June 6 to Friday, June 10, in the Boyd
Graduate Studies Research Building (200 D.W. Brooks Drive), at the
University of Georgia Athens Campus.

Our 2016 program featured activity groups led by [Ester
Dalvit](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dalvit/), [Juan
Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html), [Juanita
Pinzón-Caicedo](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~juanita/), [Paul
Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/) and Amber
Russell. You can see what they did below::

**Braids**
(Led by [Ester Dalvit](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dalvit/). Assistants: [Patrick
McFaddin](https://sites.google.com/site/pmcfaddinmathematics/) and Justin Johnson)

<blockquote>
Can you put a closed rope a round the strands at the top of a braid such that it will have a specific shape when it falls down to the bottom of the braid?

<br />
<br />

Through hands-on activities and guided learning, students will develop mathematical tools to solve this puzzle. Along the way they will discover that both braids and curves are mathematical objects, and find a way to describe these objects and their interaction using algebraic notation.

**Monster Epidemiology: Zombies, Vampires, and Werewolves**
(Led by [Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html).
Assistants: [Zerotti Woods](https://zerotti.wordpress.com/) and Elesha Coons)

<blockquote>
In this workshop we will produce mathematical models to predict the outcome of an encounter between a healthy human population (for example, the town of Watkinsville) and a few mythical creatures. We will study: (a) humans vs. one zombie, (b) humans vs. one vampire, and (c) humans vs. a competition between several vampires and several werewolves… and any other apocalyptic scenario participants can come up with. Not only students will learn how to predict who wins, but also what are the best strategies to contain these mythical monsters. The mathematical tools used in this workshop belong to the same family of models used to guide public health policies against a number of diseases. We will use Scilab, an open source mathematical package, to explore the mathematical models needed in the study of  monster epidemiology.

**Symmetries of two-dimensional repetitive patterns**
(Led by [Juanita Pinzón-Caicedo](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~juanita/).
Assistants: [Abe Varghese](https://sites.google.com/site/abrahamandmath/)
and Susanna Conine-Nakano)

<blockquote>
The two-dimensional plane can be with repetitions of some shapes without gaps or overlaps to create mosaic-like patterns. Artists like MC Escher have studied the symmetries of this patterns to create stunning works of art. We will explore the mathematics behind this patterns and we will create our own beautiful designs!

**Primes**
(Led by [Paul Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/). Assistants:
[Hans Parshall](http://hansparshall.com/) and Jadzia Dax Hutchings)

<blockquote>
We will explore several solved and unsolved problems about the set of prime numbers, ranging from classical results known to Euclid in 300 BCE to spectacular advances from just the past few years.

**Discovering Graph Theory** 
(Led by Amber Russell. Assistants: [Andrew
Maurer](https://andrewmaurer.github.io/) and Carson Aft)

<blockquote>
Through a series of guided learning projects and hands-on activities, students will discover the basic definitions and some famous results from the field of Graph Theory. Specific topics include planar graphs, graph embeddings on surfaces, and the Four Color Theorem.
